Imported from gist [joshooaj](https://gist.github.com/joshooaj/8dc5408b9e2aa077a6330d342a1e19ef) which have a hard-coded support for DynuDNS.
As the script uses [PoshACME](https://poshac.me/docs/latest/) which in its turn support a plethora of [DDNS](https://poshac.me/docs/latest/Plugins/)providers i aim to update it to support the other DDNS providers a bit easier.
I have tried to change from Dynu to DuckDNS but it seems PoshACME DuckDNS script is broken, filed a [ticket](https://github.com/rmbolger/Posh-ACME/issues/575) with them.
