Imported from gist [joshooaj](https://gist.github.com/joshooaj/8dc5408b9e2aa077a6330d342a1e19ef) which have a hard-coded support for DynuDNS.

As the script uses [PoshACME](https://poshac.me/docs/latest/) which in its turn support a plethora of [DDNS](https://poshac.me/docs/latest/Plugins/) providers i aim to update it to support the other DDNS providers a bit easier.

Also adding other dependencies for DDNS update as PoshACME does not support auto-updates for the DDNS providers.

Also nice to have everything collected on one site wehere you could file issues, discuss or contribute to it easier.
